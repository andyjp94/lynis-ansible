# Lynis complicance using ansible

This repository is an attempt to use ansible to configure a ubuntu 16.04 server to achieve a server hardening of 100% according to the output of the Lynis audit command. This is purely meant for me to learn more about ansible and securing linux servers. Also means that when I update to ubuntu 18.04 in a few months most of the configuration should be done for me.
